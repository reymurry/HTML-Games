# HTML-Games
This is a public repo containing the works I created in HTML when I was in high school.
Before loading them a "READ ME" was added per folder with the instructions to play.
To affect my past work as little as possible, I tried to keep the logic and graphics of all the games intact, so as to evaluate what my skills were in those years.


## Have fun!
