If you click "0" the number inside the cell will disappear. Any number entered in this way is temporary,
and must be verified.

2) To start a new game, select the difficulty in the combobox and then press "Avvia".

3) if you have help available, you can select a cell whose content you want to know and press "Aiuto",
revealing the correct number hidden below.

4) When you want to check the progress so far, press "Verifica", the wrong numbers will be marked in red.
Warning: Always keep at least 1 "Verifica" available for when you have finished playing!



Have fun!
